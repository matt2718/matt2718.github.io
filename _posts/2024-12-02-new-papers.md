Well, it's been a minute.

Although I rarely write about physics on here (or much of anything these days), this is still technically a "research blog", so I thought I might share an update for those of you who still have me in your RSS feeds.

First, David Poland and I [showed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12974) that 3d Gross--Neveu--Yukawa CFTs have exactly two relevant scalars operators for N ≥ 2. In plain English, this means that if you're looking for a quantum critical point in a fermionic system with a scalar order parameter, you only need to tune two parameters to reach it---as long as you have at least two kinds of fermions. The N=1 case corresponds to the super-Ising model, which *does* have a third relevant scalar, and therefore lives in a three-dimensional phase diagram.

(Strictly speaking, N refers to the number of Majorana degrees of freedom. In 3d, a Dirac spinor factorizes into four Majorana spinors, so a system with N/4 Dirac fermions will have a global symmetry group of O(N) or O(N/2)² ⋊ Z_2 depending on what the Yukawa coupling looks like. For more details, see appendix C of the ["The Gross--Neveu--Yukawa archipelago"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02492).)

Second, I contributed to a (new bootstrap study of stress tensors in the critical 3d Ising model)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15300]! Highlights include [tighter bounds on critical exponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_critical_exponents), bounds on the scaling dimensions of parity-odd operators, and some preliminary evidence that the Ising model is extremal in the space of CFTs. It's also "1.3833683(35)% fermionic"---see our discussion section for an interpretation.
