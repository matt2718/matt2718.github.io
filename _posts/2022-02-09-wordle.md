I had a half-written post on optimizing [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) guesses
with Shannon entropy. Apparently Grant Sanderson had the same idea and presented it better than I
could've hoped to, so I'll just link to [his
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) instead. Check it out!

I've posted my own code [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/matt2718/wordler). I'm sure it's suboptimal
in many ways, but I had a lot of fun writing it. "SOARE" seems to be the highest-entropy first guess
against the provided list of answers, followed closely by "ROATE" and "RAISE".
