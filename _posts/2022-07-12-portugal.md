I've been in Porto the past few weeks for [Bootstrap
2022](https://sites.google.com/view/bootstrap2022/). The conference has been a wonderful experience
so far (aside from the baffling lack of water fountains in university buildings), and if you'd like
to watch some of the talks, you can find recordings on [the collaboration's YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWLG2q2275RuUJ5eNSCCFA/featured).

I'm really enjoying exploring the city! Climate-wise, Porto is [not unlike San
Francisco](https://weatherspark.com/compare/y/32397~557/Comparison-of-the-Average-Weather-in-Porto-and-San-Francisco),
so it's been a welcome change from New Haven's usual summer mugginess. The food and wine are quite
good as well---the [francesinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha) is a local sandwhich
which deserves to be *much* better-known in the US, and the region is home to both port and [vinho
verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinho_Verde), neither of which I'd tried before this trip. I
expected more of a language barrier, but it's been possible to get around with only a few basic
phrases.

I'll be in Boston on Saturday and back in New Haven after that. If you happen to be in either city
and we know each other IRL, send me a message and we'll grab lunch.
