Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an undergrad physics student at CU Boulder. My current research focuses on plasma
simulation algorithms, and my hobbies range from playing quizbowl to reading to programming to
baking to playing guitar terribly.

### My papers:

[Efficient Fourier Space Particle Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03742) (submitted for
  publication)
